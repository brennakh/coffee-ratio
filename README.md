# coffee : ratio app

### [Link to Project](https://coffeeratio.netlify.app/) 

This app was inspired by my constantly forgetting how much water I needed to brew coffee in the morning. Instead of googling "coffee water ratio" everyday, I created a simple way to figure out how much water I needed based on the amount of beans I had.
